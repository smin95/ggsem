# AI-Powered Network Layout Generation {#sec-ai-powered-network-layout-generation}

The GenAI layout feature in ggsem uses artificial intelligence to automatically generate optimized visual arrangements for your network diagrams, potentially providing unique layouts that may not be achievable with traditional algorithms.

## Getting Started: API Configuration

```{r}
#| echo: false 
#| fig-cap: "Figure 1. Setting GenAI options for generating network layout." 
#| fig-align: "center" 
knitr::include_graphics("network_genAI/network_genAI.png")
```

Before using AI features for network layout generation, you'll need to configure API access:

### Step-by-Step Setup:

1.  Navigate to the **"Data, Model and AI Specifics"** panel in the SEM Diagram section.

2.  In the **"AI Model"** dropdown, select your preferred service:

    -   **Google Gemini** - Excellent for general SEM tasks
    -   **OpenAI GPT** - Strong with complex model descriptions
    -   **Mistral AI** - Balanced performance and efficiency
    -   **Anthropic Claude** - Advanced reasoning capabilities
    -   **Ollama (Local)** - Complete privacy with local processing

3.  **Configure API Settings**

    -   **For Cloud Providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Mistral, Claude):**

        -   Locate the API key input field that appears after selecting your provider

        -   Obtain your API key from the provider's developer portal:

            -   Google AI Studio: <https://aistudio.google.com/>

            -   OpenAI Platform: <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys>

            -   Mistral Platform: <https://console.mistral.ai/>

            -   Anthropic Console: <https://console.anthropic.com/>

        -   Paste your API key into the input field

    -   **For Ollama (Local):**

        -   Ensure Ollama is installed and running on your local machine (`ollama serve`)

        -   Enter your preferred local model name (e.g., "llama2", "mistral", "codellama")

        -   No API key required for local operation

4.  **Verify Connection**

    -   The interface will indicate successful API configuration

    -   Test by generating a simple model to confirm functionality

## AI-Powered Layout Generation

The GenAI feature automatically generates fresh layouts for your network diagrams.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Figure 2. SEM Diagram Generated with Layout Created by GenAI."
#| fig-align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics("network_genAI/network_genAI_layout.png")
```

#### Example 1: Generating an AI-Optimized Layout

**Step 1: Configure API Access**

1.  In the **SEM Diagram** section, open the **"Data, Model and AI Specifics"** panel.

2.  Select your preferred AI provider from the **"AI Model"** dropdown.

    -   In this example, **Google Gemini** is used because it is free.

3.  Enter your valid **API key** in the provided field.

4.  *Once configured, the "GenAI" option will become available in the layout dropdown in **Network Diagram** menu.*

**Step 2: Generate the Network Layout**

6.  Navigate to the **"Network Layout Settings"** panel.

7.  From the **"Choose Layout Algorithm"** dropdown, select **"GenAI"**.

    -   Set **Layout Width (X)** and **Layout Height (Y)** as `35` (see Figure 2).
    -   Set **random seed** as `14324` for reproducibility

8.  *(Optional)* In the **"Additional prompts for layout"** text box, provide brief context to guide the AI (under 30 words).

9.  Click the **"Draw a Network"** button.

    -   The AI generates and displays a novel layout for your network.
    -   **Important**: GenAI layouts are non-deterministic - running again may produce different arrangements

**Step 3: Customize the Aesthetics**

10. Use **Node Settings**,**Edge Settings**, and **Annotation Settings** panels to modify:
    -   Colors, shapes, and sizes
    -   Font properties and label positioning
    -   Edge styles and curvature
    -   *All standard aesthetic controls function with GenAI-generated layouts*

**Step 4: Apply and Lock Your Customizations**

11. Click **"Apply Changes"** to update the diagram with new aesthetics
    -   This preserves the GenAI layout while modifying visual styles
    -   Does not trigger layout re-generation
12. Click **"Finalize a Network"** to lock the diagram
    -   Prevents further changes to layout and aesthetics via Network menu

    -   Maintains the AI-optimized arrangement

### Key Features of GenAI Layout:

-   **Non-deterministic**: Different generations may produce varied but valid layouts

-   **Context-aware**: AI considers node names and network structure in layout decisions

-   **Optimized spacing**: Automatically balances node placement and connection clarity

-   **Novel perspectives**: May reveal network patterns not apparent with traditional algorithms
