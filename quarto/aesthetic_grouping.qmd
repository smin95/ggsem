# Aesthetic Grouping {#sec-started}

The Aesthetic Grouping feature in `ggse`m allows you to apply consistent visual styling to groups of unlocked elements. This functionality is only available for elements that are **not locked** and when working with **non-lavaan, non-network diagrams** (i.e., `locked = FALSE`, `lavaan = FALSE`, `network = FALSE`). Unlocked elements are shown as green rows in the output tables, instead of red or white.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Figure 1. Aesthetic Grouping options are mainly applicable for elements in green rows in the output tables"
#| fig-align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics("aesthetic_grouping/green_rows.png")
```

In other words, you need to have pressed **Finalize a SEM** or **Finalize a Network** for SEM or Network elements respectively to use options in this menu for **each group**. The **Finalize** button works for one group at a time.

Use **Apply Changes** to modify the aesthetics unless other buttons are presented.

### Group Aesthetics

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Figure 2. Group Aesthetics"
#| fig-align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics("aesthetic_grouping/group_aesthetics.png")
```

Apply coordinated styling to different element types within selected groups:

-   **Points**: Modify color, size, shape, and transparency for unlocked nodes and points

-   **Lines**: Customize color, width, line type, and transparency for unlocked edges and paths

-   **Annotations**: Adjust color, size, font face, and transparency for unlocked text labels

-   **Self-loop Arrows**: Style color, width, and transparency for unlocked circular arrows

**Usage**: Select a group from the dropdown menu, then choose the element type(s) you wish to style. All changes apply consistently to all unlocked elements within the selected group after clicking **Apply Changes**.

### Group Label Edit

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Figure 3. Group Label Edit"
#| fig-align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics("aesthetic_grouping/group_label_edit.png")
```

Manage and customize group labels for better organization and visualization:

#### Show (or Update) Group Labels {.unnumbered}

-   **Label Position**: Choose from 8 positions (top, bottom, left, right, and corner placements)

-   **Label Styling**: Customize color, size, font family, and style

-   **Alignment**: Labels can be relative to each group's elements, or you can specify X and/or Y coordinates of labels to align.

-   **Offset Control**: Adjust label distance from group elements

-   **Note:** Also works for SEM (`lavaan = TRUE`) and network elements (`network = TRUE`)

-   Click **Show Group Labels** to add or update group labels on your diagrams.

#### Rename Group Labels {.unnumbered}

-   **Rename Group Labels?**: Choose a group to rename using the dropdown.

-   **New Group Name**: Type new name of the selected group.

#### Modify Group Labels (By Rows) {.unnumbered}

This menu works by selecting rows in the output tables, and applies to selected rows only.

-   **Reassign Labels**: Select elements of other groups from output tables to existing groups

-   **Rename Labels**: Create new group labels for selected elements in the output tables

-   **Clear Groups**: Remove group assignments from selected elements in the output tables

#### Delete Group Labels {.unnumbered}

-   **Delete Groups**: Remove all elements associated with a specific group

-   **Lock Groups**: Protect groups from further modification while maintaining visibility. This sets `lock = TRUE`

### Group Position

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Figure 4. Group Position"
#| fig-align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics("aesthetic_grouping/group_position.png")
```

Transform the spatial arrangement of element groups:

#### Position XY Shift {.unnumbered}

-   Move entire groups horizontally or vertically while maintaining internal spatial relationships

-   Group is specified using the **Which Group to Modify** dropdown at the top.

#### Align Groups {.unnumbered}

-   **Alignment Methods**: Horizontal centers, vertical centers, or edge alignment (left, right, top, bottom)

-   **Multi-group Selection**: Align multiple groups simultaneously for consistent layout

-   **Relative Positioning**: Maintain current spatial relationships while applying alignment

-   Groups are selected using **Groups to align** box. This works when there are two or more groups.
