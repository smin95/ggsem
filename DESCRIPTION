Description: It allows users to draw path diagrams for structural equation modeling (SEM) and small-to-medium sized networks interactively using the ggplot2 engine. Its Shiny app provides an interface that allows extensive customization, and creates CSV outputs, which can then be used to recreate the figures either using the Shiny app or in a typical ggplot2 workflow.
